# CSE2120 - Data and Data Structures

Today is the day I find out I'm an idiot. 

Data structures are organizational, management, and formatting tools for storing large data sets. In programming, these structures are stored in variables or other data structures. There are many different types of data structures: Tuples, Lists, Arrays, Dictionaries, (IB) Queues, and Stacks. (IB)

## Types of Data Structures in Python

### Tuples 

A *tuple* is a static data structure, where the data is immutable. All data is declared when the variable is created. 

```python
# Tuple 
A_TUPLE = (1, 3, 5.0, "eleven", 13) # uses paranthesis
A_TUPLE = (1, 3, 5.0, "eleven", 17)

NAME = (firstname, lastname)
DATE = (year, month, day)

print(A_TUPLE) # output (1, 3, 5.0, "eleven", 17)
print(A_TUPLE[1]) # output 3
```

Python allows you to use multiple data types within a data structure, but other languages (such as Java) will not let you do so. 

When using data structures, each individual data node within the structure is assigned an **index number**. This index number identifies the specific location that the data is stored in the strucutre. Index numbers begin counting at **0** and increases as integers. 

(IB) - IB does not use the term "tuple" because it is a python-specific term. Instead, IB will use the term array. 

### Lists

A *list* is a one dimensional array that is a dynamic data structure, where individual nodes are mutable. 

```python
# List 
A_LIST = [1, 3, 5.0, 7, "eleven", 13]
A_LIST[5] = 17 # updates a single value in a list 
print(A_LIST) # outputs [1, 3, 5.0, 7, "eleven", 17]
print(A_LIST[4]) # outputs eleven (without quotations) 
```

Note: Despite tuples using parentheses and lists using brackets, when declaring an index value or node, the index number is always in [brackets]. 

(IB) Lists in Java, which is what IB pseudocode is based upon, calls dynamic lists "ArrayLists."  

### Static vs Dynamic Arrays 

In most cases, either a static or dynamic array can be used to store data. However, there are instances where one is preferable over the other. 

For data that should not be changed independently, static arrays are preferable. 

- Storing screen resolution 
- Storing a position on a 2D or 3D plane 
- Storing identification information of an individual 

Oftentimes, tuples are used to store information that is difficult to change. For example, your name links to your student ID. One should never be changed in a program without changing the other. 

### Data Structure Indexing and Calling

Frequently, calling on a single value within the data structure is needed instead of the entire structure. Therefore, there needs to be a process of identifying a single value. Each value has a positional index number associated with it. 

```python 
indexNumber = [0, 1, 2, 3, ...]
```

To reference a specific value, include the list name followed immediately with the index number in [square brackets]. 

```python 
A_LIST = ["This", "is", "a", "sentence."]
print(A_LIST[3]) # sentence. 
```

Array indexing has forward (head-to-tail) indexing and backwards (tail-to-head) indexing. Either index number will call the data value. 

```python 
A_LIST = ["This", "is", "a", "sentence."]
# index     0      1     2      3 
# index    -4     -3    -2     -1
print(A_LIST[-2]) # a
```

To reference a subset of values, you can include a start index value and an end index value separated by a colon. Note that a subset starts at the starting index value, but goes up to and **not** including the end index value. 

```python
A_LIST = ["This", "is", "a", "sentence."]
print(A_LIST[-2:2]) # []
print(A_LIST[1:3]) # ["is", "a"]
```

There are two shortcuts to creating sublists from the beginning and the end of the list. When starting a sublist from the beginning of the list, omit the first number, and when creating one from the end, omit the last number. 

```python
A_LIST = ["This", "is", "a", "sentence."]
print(A_LIST[2:]) # ["a", "sentence."]
print(A_LIST[:3]) # ["This", "is", "a"]
```

All lists also have a length property, where the total number of data values is callable using the `len(LIST)` function. 

```python
len(A_LIST) # 4 
for i in range len(A_LIST):
    print(A_LIST[i])
"""
This
is
a
sentence. 
"""
# the same as doing 
print(A_LIST[0])
print(A_LIST[1])
print(A_LIST[2])
print(A_LIST[3])
```

### Manipulating Data in Lists

Data in a dynamic list can undergo many processes. They are often summarized by the acronym CRUD (create, read, update, delete). 

### Creating Data in Arrays

#### Appending Data to the End of a List 

To add data to the tail of a list, use the `append(DATA)` dot function. 

```python
A_LIST = ["This", "is", "a", "sentence."]
A_LIST.append("Hi there!")
print(A_LIST) # ["This", "is", "a", "sentence.", "Hi there!"]
A_LIST.append("How are you?")
print(A_LIST) # ["This", "is", "a", "sentence.", "Hi there!", "How are you?"]
```

#### Inserting Data to a Specific Index Value Within a List 

To add data to a specific index position in the list, use the `index(index, DATA)` dot function. This function should be used sparingly, because it shifts the indexes of the other nodes by one. This may result in mis-addressing data. 

```python
A_LIST = ["this", "is", "a", "sentence."]
A_LIST.insert(2, "not") 
print(A_LIST) # ["this", "is", "not", "a", "sentence."]
```

### Reading Data in Arrays 

All examples are found in the introduction above. 

```python
print(A_LIST[1]) # is
```

### Updating Data in Arrays

REMEMBER that tuples cannot update a single value. Instead, the entire tuple must be re-declared with the new value. To update a single list, the list node can be assigned a new value. 

To update a specific index within an array, simply re-assign the index. This is preferable to inserting data to a specific value because the other nodes are not changed. 

```python 
A_LIST = ["this", "is", "a", "sentence."]
A_LIST[0] = "This"
print(A_LIST) # ["This", "is", "a", "sentence."]
```

### Deleting Values in Data Arrays 

Deleting data from an array will change the overall length of the array and may re-assign new index values to pre-existing values within the array. 

#### Pop Data Off an Array 

To pop a value off an array, the `pop(index)` dot function will remove the value at the index number. When using `.pop()` data is removed from the list, but not destroyed. If desired, the removed data can be stored in a new variable. 

Note: If no index value is given, `.pop()` will remove the highest index value. 

```python
A_LIST = ["This", "is", "a", "sentence."]
A_LIST.pop()
print(A_LIST) # ["This", "is", "a"]
A_LIST.pop(1)
print(A_LIST) # ["This", "a"]
VARIABLE = A_LIST.pop(0)
print(VARIABLE) # This
print(A_LIST) # ["a"]
```

#### Remove Data From an Array

To remove a value off an array, the `.remove(VALUE)` dot function will remove the first instance of the value while traversing the array from head-to-tail. 

```python
A_LIST = ["This", "is", "a", "sentence."]
A_LIST.remove("a")
print(A_LIST) # ["This", "is", "sentence."]

NEW_LIST = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 11, 17]
NEW_LIST.remove(11)
print(NEW_LIST) # [2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 11, 17]
```

### What Data is Stored in an Array? 

In python, an array can store any combination of data types; however, more structerd languages, such as Java, an array can only store one type of data. 

Furthermore, python cannot create *empty* arrays, like other languages. 

Note: IB follows traditional array limitations of only having one data type in the array. 

```python
# you can do this
ARRAY = [] # the list is full of null
# you cant just have a list of nothing 
ARRAY = 
```
